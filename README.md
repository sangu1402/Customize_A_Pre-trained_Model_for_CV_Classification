# Customize_A_Pre-trained_Model_for_CV_Classification
Objective - Transfer learning using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has become a widely adopted strategy in computer vision (CV) tasks. In this assignment, I used the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset, which includes 8,189 flower images classified into 102 categories.
